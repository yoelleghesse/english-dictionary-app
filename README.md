The PyQt6 Word Definition application allows users to input a word, and it retrieves its definition from a pre-defined JSON dataset. If the word exists in the dataset, it displays the definition; otherwise, it prompts the user to double-check the input.

Clone the repo:

``git clone https://github.com/your-username/pyqt6-word-definition.git``

Install the dependencies:

``pip install PyQt6``

Run the application:

``python pyqt6_word_definition.py``
